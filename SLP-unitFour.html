                <p>
                     The purpose of the program is to be able to view a hypothetical simulation of taking a walk through a forest space. There were plans to make three starting routes that each had their own choices and results, but one path is fulfilled with content and has many branching results in itself. The app functions by checking the choices the user has maed by the dropdowns and uses the keyword entered in the text input to alter the reult of the final display of text. The user may have a need to become entertained by a piece of media and this app could be the walk-related answer. Actions such as the changing of screens based on navigation and the selections made in the drop down, along with the fill in for the user's least favorite activity are all sources that provide the necessary data for the program itself to make something happen. The program also seraches for a keyword "groundskeeper" to reveal another alternative ending to the path as well.

                 Dane recommendeded to me that I make more visual designs for the app. In terms of appearance, my app can look a tad lackluster, and I completely agree. General improvements would entail more colorful selections and personalizations in the text, buttons, and usage of borders for some text blocks. The visual improvements generate a higher eye-candy effect and make the product appear more desireable, to a point where Walking Simulations might appear as awe-striking as sliced bread.
