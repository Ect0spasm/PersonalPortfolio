            <p>
                Growing additions are to be included in this portfolio. In the meantime, there is this logo. This is a
                binary-pixel art piece of graphic design I decidedly referred to as Aquamarine Lovewatch. It is at it's
                core, a gradient including colors from aquamarine to teal, then black. Amidst the center of the art is a
                simple clock, wherein it tells the time and serves as measurement for the passing of time in this
                abstract place of vast color. To me, the logo represents the passing of time and the constant change
                that it entails. To explain how I truly made the design, I'll have to step back a little. Visualize what
                happened and type words that are pleasing to my eyes and mind. So far they are ugly, so I have to paste
                and edit an excerpt of a story I made some time ago, it's related to this. <br>
                The calmest rain gently tapped against the window, casual patters of water droplets lightly knocking on
                the window in front of him. The constant blinking of the text cursor defied all opposition provided by
                the blank-white expanse surrounding the document. Despite it's rebellion against this lit canvas and
                it's beckon for more well-put symbols of grey to join the empty space, the bar became incessant for me.
                It called for something I had null ability to provide. It was frustrating, How could something so simple
                fail to be put into words? I felt all was for naught, to scour and comb through the repetitive
                information of my conventionally mundane choice. Behind all the saturated hues and lightness, I felt no
                ilks of passion for this spectrum of color. I, at this point in time, were assigned to write a
                historically descriptive essay about colors in the palest, dullest, and most forgetful way you can
                imagine. With a disapproving sigh, I turned away from technological tome of binary translation and
                stared at my own bedroom ceiling. It was the first time I realized I never actually looked at it before.
                This feeling of morose, maybe its what I get for devoting all my time to the floor. -"Settle down, you
                typing disaster. Look up and ask yourself, what do you see in the plaster?" It was late. I was tired. My
                mind, was tired, my body felt dull and sluggish. The grated lines of my computer screen were still
                engrained in my eyes as I stared at the subtle textures and shapes impressed upon my ceiling. Like a
                dream, I saw figures of familiarity come and go untilâ€¦ Until I got bored. I peered out of my window and
                looked into the dark, pouring expanse surrounding the comforts of the night-lit bedroom. Amongst the dim
                rainy environment was a rare-looking sedan with the reflective tint of an adjacent turquoise. This
                near-aqua irradiated the surrounding rain pellets with its nostalgically bright gleams. Just as fast as
                it revealed itself, it passed by, leaving only the blurry imprint of its coloration in my mind. I felt
                something when I saw a shade that specific of aquamarine, something vastly familiar. <br>
                By the way, I chose no copyright as the universal deed, because I lack the recreancy of holding it to
                myself. They are free to take this little art piece and do what they wish with it, as they should. I
                imagine that lossy compression would be sufficient in conveying the appearance of the logo, mainly
                because it is just a bunch of differently colored boxes and lacks specific detailing.

                This art piece was created by cutting the negative space into and from a square black index card that
                represents the colors that refect eachother in terms of shape of The understandable vocational
                indredients that source for the creation of the piece itself.
