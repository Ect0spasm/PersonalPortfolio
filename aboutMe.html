            <h2>Awards and Achievements</h2>
        <p>When it comes to the abilities of my own personal achievements,  I have a garnered documented structure of progressively increasing content. This content entails the furthuring features that are to come and already exist in some capacity.</p>

                <h2>Music</h2>
            <p> I love-a the rock music! And the raps n' jazzes. Hoewever, I'm not particularly adequete in those areas of musical genre.</p>

            <h2 class="art">Art</h2>
            <p>I have a interest in art made online, mainly sourcing from the website Newgrounds. Some users that come to mind are JamesLee, Chupabara, Ennuikal, Zals, LeviRamirez, and JohnnyUtah to name a few. I like analyzing a piece and thinking about a creator's design process.</p>

            <h2>Videogames</h2>
            <p>The no-brainer when it comes to personal intersts. My taste in games stems from original storytelling and explosive gameplay. If there are ragdoll physics it's already a high ranking masterpiece of media.</p>

            <img src="images/unnamed.jpg" id="pspPic" alt="School crossing sign at an angle. ">
            <p>I plan on going to Clovis Community College for prerequisites, and majoring in a tech-oriented industry. Alternative routes are also being thought of, as to generate more concise ideas for potential futures. One of these options are going to Union Pacific University in Anguin, California for its learniing environment and nursing program. Yet another path lies in multimedia. Making and editing videos and media online. </p>
