            <h1>Post Secondary Plan</h1>
            <p>I plan on going to Clovis Community College for prerequisites, and majoring in a tech-oriented industry. Alternative routes are also being thought up, as to generate more concise ideas for potential futures. One of these options are going to Union Pacific University in Anguin California, for its learniing environment and nursing program. Yet another path lies in multimedia. Making and editing videos and media online. </p>
