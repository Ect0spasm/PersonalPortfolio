                <h2>Music</h2>
            <p> I love-a the rock music! And the raps n' jazzes. Hoewever, I'm not particularly adequete in those areas of musical genre.</p>

            <h2>Art</h2>
            <p>I have a interest in art made online, mainly sourcing from the website Newgrounds. Some users that come to mind are JamesLee, Chupabara, Ennuikal, Zals, LeviRamirez, and JohnnyUtah to name a few. I like analyzing a piece and thinking about a creator's design process.</p>

            <h2>Videogames</h2>
            <p>The no-brainer when it comes to personal intersts. My taste in games stems from original storytelling and explosive gameplay. If there are ragdoll physics it's already a high ranking masterpiece of media.</p>

            <h1>Post Secondary Plan</h1>
            <p>I plan on going to Clovis Community College for prerequisites, and majoring in a tech-oriented industry. Alternative routes are also being thought of, as to generate more concise ideas for potential futures. One of these options are going to Union Pacific University in Anguin, California for its learniing environment and nursing program. Yet another path lies in multimedia. Making and editing videos and media online. </p>
