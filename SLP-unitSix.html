                <h3>The Big Ol' Response</h3>

                <p>
                    Ah yes, here we go again. Let's buckle our bootstraps and safety belts as I dive in head first on describing the mental collision course that kaleidoscopically shaped my silly theme song. First, Inspiration. The song <em>Kilimanjaro Cookout</em> from Buddy Rich's 1973 album <em>The Roar of '74.</em> Now I couldn't embrace any of the jazzy details pertaining to brass instruments as they were sorely missing from my prevorbial toolbox of Music Lab creativity, but I still did a subpar job if I do say so myself. The genre itself for the theme song is preemptively jazzy, if I can use the expression loosely, with hints of classical strings and an overtaking potency of random electronic orchestrations littered amongst the bars. Detailing my functions, I have a great many of them and a couple appear to fail successfully in making their nice sounds. Just nit-picky things that could be oversimplified and de-cluttered so to speak. Such as the function I labled [DIG] having a back and forth repition between two of the same drum beats, it's set to repeat twice but runs the beat four times as an awesome result. Overall, these functions manage the complexity of the song by synergizing and being designed to intertwine with one another, certainly working out in some places better than others throughout the track. The functions are able to be blended into loops while also being able to serve as their own stand alone pieces if designed in such a way. The instruments I inculed into my loops were orchestral strings, guitar, plucking and synth notes, drum set and electronically gritty drum set, as well as various sound effects. For most of the song, I utilized the drum sets for their wider range of flexible note placement compared to the signature notes. The notes only allow up or down arpeggios with the other options being that of playing each note at the same time, leaving ample empty space for nothing except empty air and disatisfaction, and random playing which would make an odd combination of the chosen notes that would sound different every time played. Limited and uncanny in my opinion. I tried going for a drums focused route and I feel that I accomplished it thoroughly.
