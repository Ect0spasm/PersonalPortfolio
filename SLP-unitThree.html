                    The purpose that my app strives towards achieving is simplistic in its essence. Visiting this project will subject the user to a miniature cascade of fashionable trends that are odd and recognized historically. The visitable sections are as follows: Time periods of fashion, as well as examples of ridiculous fashion. Any users interested in this concept might get a kick out of the content, in fact It's my goal that they do. Beyond the subject of its theme, it is a rather comedically leaning production. The functionality of Frenzied Trendies reaches out to simple clicking interaction that changes pages or appears to alter them.By user input of a clicking interaction, the resulting output will change the page. Despite this simplicity, the method is versatile. It can be made to recreate the process and results of a quiz, given that you either choose the correct questions, or you fail the quiz and start over. My app originally had the concept of utilizing this method, but due to time constraints, it ultimately shifted into a different form.

                Dane provided his integral recommendations towards the app by suggesting that the sound interaction should be indefinitely interactable, whereas in the past iteration it was playable once, then requiring a refresh of the page to return to its normal state. He also pointed out an inconsistency with the subheadings in some pages compared to others in terms of letter capitalization.Perhaps this was simply a note of my creative prowess and rebellious perspective against the common ideas of what correct capitalization grammar is, no but I truthfully just messed up and wasn't paying attention, my bad.  Promptly, these notices have been changed and made into a more complete culmination for the app as a whole .In each page of my app there is a title, under the title I have a subheading. The problem that I hadn't noticed at first glance was that the pages had an inconsistent style of title capitalization in some places and a lack thereof in others. Within my page called Understanding the Style, it contains a checkbox button that when clicked will play a silly sound and then disappear, the running tradeoff is that the sound interaction is lost after the click takes place, leaving empty space and a lack of sound interactivity. I now think that a good idea would be for an onevent to change what sound the checkbox plays after it's been clicked for the first time, but lost time has surpassed the opportunity. The improvements that were implemented helped my app because they integrated a more streamlined usability and a better visual furnish to the text components of the app itself.

                "Imagine if you will, a world where the only limitations to create are that of the human mind. A world where technology has advanced itself to a point of near incomprehensible reach. In this place, the innovative control of the human essence is equally present as it is absent. Enter <em>Frenzied Trendies</em>, the product of a student's yearn to create. This yearn has led to an application that of which scribes and accounts for various stereotypes of fashion throughout time. Little do the users know, that in traversing through this application they have traversed themselves into, the Twilight Zone."

                Speaker snorts Frenchly, â€œTasteful. It is somewhat comical in it's pure... silliness. A true savant such as myself would know that there is a delicate equilibrium to fashion, but anything goes in this rite of passage."
